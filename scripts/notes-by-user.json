        "Andrew is 17 years old and was referred to us on March 29th 2018, after he was approached while sleeping rough in Manchester.\n He claims to have been sexually abused by his step-father between from the age of 14 and decided to leave just after turning 16.",

        "Andrew started drinking heavily around June 2017 but has given up alcohol since the start of 2018, he says that he often feels like drinking when he's around other young people but has so far managed to resist.",

        "Mike (Andrew's father) has always denied that he was ever abusive in any way and Andrew feels unable to take his allegations to the police given his criminal conviction of petty theft (May 2017)",

        "Andrew has been couch-surfing with friends since about August 2018 but occasionally stays with his mother whenever his father goes away to Liverpool to visit his ex-wife.",

        "His mother (Emily) says that she is worried about him but never believes that his father (Mike) is capable of the alleged sexual abuse."
